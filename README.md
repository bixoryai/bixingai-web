- ✅ All 9 pages migrated to Astro + Tailwind
- ✅ 12 Astro components created
- ✅ Visual parity verified for all pages
- ✅ Performance optimizations applied
- ✅ CI stabilization complete (lint/build/type checks green)
- ⏳ Phase 6: Production cutover pending

**Staging**: Astro site on `develop` at https://bixingai.bixory.ai

**Production**: `main` currently preserves Jekyll backup state pending cutover from `develop`

## Getting Started

### Astro Development (Recommended - v2.0)

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bixoryai/bixingai-web.git
   cd bixingai-web
   git checkout develop
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start dev server
   ```bash
   cd astro-site
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser

4. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Legacy Jekyll Development (v1.x)

This path is for backup/reference only while production cutover is pending.

1. Clone and switch to main branch
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bixoryai/bixingai-web.git
   cd bixingai-web
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Install Jekyll dependencies
   ```bash
   bundle install
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```

3. Serve the built site from the `_site` directory

### Code Quality

Run linting checks:
```bash
npm run lint          # Run all linters
npm run lint:js       # JavaScript only
npm run lint:html     # HTML only
npm run lint:css      # CSS only
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix issues
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes** and commit with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commit prefixes for semantic versioning:
   - `feat:`, `feature:`, `add:`, `new:`, `implement:`, `create:`, `enhance:`, `improve:` → **MINOR** version bump
   - `fix:`, `bug:`, `patch:`, `hotfix:`, `security:`, `lint:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:` → **PATCH** version bump
   - `breaking:`, `major:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`, `api change:`, `remove:`, `delete:`, `drop:` → **MAJOR** version bump

3. **Create Pull Request** to `develop` branch for review

4. **Merge to main** for production release:
   - Create PR from `develop` → `main`
   - Once merged, automated release workflow will:
     - Analyze PR commits for version bump type
     - Automatically bump version (patch/minor/major)
     - Create new version tag (e.g., v1.0.1)
     - Update package.json
     - Generate detailed release notes
     - Create GitHub release
   - No manual intervention required!

### CI/CD & Releases

- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`): Runs automatically on push/PR to `main` or `develop`
  - JavaScript linting validation (ESLint)
  - HTML linting validation (HTMLHint)
  - CSS linting validation (Stylelint)
  - Basic functionality tests
  - Automated deployments (preview for develop, production for main)

- **Automated Releases** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Triggered **only** when PRs are merged from `develop` → `main`
  - Intelligent version bumping based on commit message analysis
  - Automatic tag creation (e.g., v1.0.1, v1.1.0, v2.0.0)
  - Detailed release notes generation from PR commits
  - GitHub release creation with quality metrics
  - Manual override available via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch
  - **Important**: Direct pushes to `main` do NOT trigger releases (prevents infinite loops)

See `.github/workflows/` for complete workflow configurations.
