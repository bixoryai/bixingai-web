# Essential Information Needed

## 1. Company basics:
   * **What's your company name?**  
     Bixing Technology
   * **What specific AI services/products do you offer?**  
     Consists of 3 components: AI Education/Training, AI Custom Solutions Development (including AI Data Services, AI Model Training and Deployment, Custom AI Apps/Agents Development), and Enterprise AI Consultation and Implementation Service
   * **Who is your target audience (enterprise, developers, consumers)?**  
     Mostly enterprises with various AI empowerment needs. There may be some consumer targeting AI apps down the road.

## 2. Business goals:
   * **What are the primary objectives of the website (lead generation, product showcases, etc.)?**  
     Primarily for company brand introduction and product/service showcase. 
   * **Do you need any specific conversion actions (demo requests, newsletter signups)?**  
     No money transaction conversion, but contact and social media following conversion. 

## 3. Content requirements:
   * **Do you have existing brand assets (logo, color scheme, images)?**  
     Yes I have logo and some images available, but open to have new ones. No color scheme defined yet, but I prefer dark/blue themed futuristic technology feel, with vibrant contrasting visual display.
   * **Do you need specific AI features integrated into the website itself?**  
     For most part of the website, it would be static introduction content with some visual display. For interactive AI features, it would be about showing demo the AI Custom Solution Development business component so that customers can quickly understand what our product/services and our capabilities are. 
   * **Any competitor websites you admire or want to differentiate from?**  
     None yet.

## 4. Technical considerations:
   * **Do you have hosting preferences?**  
     Initially, it would be hosted with Github Page.
   * **Any specific requirements for analytics, SEO, or third-party integrations?**  
     Nothing special other than common best practices.
   * **Expected traffic volume and performance expectations?**  
     The site won't be heavily visited until we decide to build some functional AI apps/agents for end users' application. But this could start with general static introduction with a "Contact for More Info" first. And we could always showcase offline in private meetings.
