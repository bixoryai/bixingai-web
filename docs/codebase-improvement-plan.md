## 1. Path Reference Standardization ✅ COMPLETED

### Issues Addressed
- Standardized path references across all menu pages (services, about, contact, careers, insights)
- Implemented consistent approach for both local development and GitHub Pages deployment
- Created enhanced path helper utility for reliable path resolution

### Improvements Implemented

1. **Consistent path strategy implemented**:
   - Added `data-path-to-root` attribute to all menu pages
   - Enhanced `path-helper.js` with robust path resolution functions
   - Updated `components.js` to use standardized path handling

2. **HTML files updated**:
   - All menu pages now have the correct `data-path-to-root="../../"` attribute
   - Consistent structure with header and footer placeholders
   - Fixed asset references to use relative paths
     ```html
     <!-- Root pages -->
     <body data-path-to-root="">
     
     <!-- Pages in subdirectories -->
     <body data-path-to-root="../">
     ```

3. **Standardize resource references**:
   - Update CSS references: `href="[path-to-root]assets/css/styles.css"`
   - Update JS references: `src="[path-to-root]assets/js/components.js"`
